	<strong>  Stonehenge  </strong></p>


	<p>Stonehenge, prehistoric stone circle monument, cemetery, and archaeological site located on Salisbury Plain, about 8 miles (13 km) north of Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. Though there is no definite evidence as to the intended purpose of Stonehenge, it was presumably a religious site and an expression of the power and wealth of the chieftains, aristocrats, and priests who had it built—many of whom were buried in the numerous barrows close by. It was aligned on the Sun and possibly used for observing the Sun and Moon and working out the farming calendar. Or perhaps the site was dedicated to the world of the ancestors, separated from the world of the living, or was a healing centre.

	<strong> The British Museum   </strong></p>


	<p >With collections of antiquities that are among the world's finest, a visit to the British Museum is undoubtedly one of the top free things to do in London. This superb museum holds more than 13 million artifacts from Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, the Roman Empire, China, and Europe. The most famous ancient artifacts are the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon in Athens, as well as the famous Rosetta Stone.

But there are many other outstanding pieces on show here that help make this one of the best places to visit in London. The Ancient Egyptian collection is the largest outside of Cairo, and the hoard of Roman silver dating from the fourth century known as the Mildenhall Treasure, unearthed in Suffolk in 1942, is nothing short of spectacular.

	<strong>   Tower of London  </strong></p>


	<p >Prison, palace, treasure vault, observatory, and menagerie: the Tower of London has done it all and it's one of the top attractions in London. Widely considered the most important building in England, there's enough to see and do at this World Heritage Site to keep visitors busy for hours.

The centerpiece of this Thames-side fortress is the White Tower. Built in 1078 by William the Conqueror, it's home to amazing exhibits, such as Line of Kings. The world's oldest visitor attraction, the collection was established in 1652 with a remarkable display of royal armor.

Other highlights include the impressive Crown Jewels exhibition, classic Yeoman Warder Tours, the Royal Mint, and exhibits and displays regarding prisoners and executions. All told, the Tower of London covers some 18 acres, so there's a great deal of exploring to do.

	<strong>  The Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine  </strong></p><br>


	<p >The Colosseum and the Arch of ConstantineAs the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, the silhouette of the Flavian Amphitheatre is to Rome. The largest structure left to us by Roman antiquity, the Colosseum still provides the model for sports arenas - present-day football stadium design is clearly based on this oval Roman plan.

The building was begun by Vespasian in AD 72, and after his son Titus enlarged it by adding the fourth story, it was inaugurated in the year AD 80 with a series of splendid games. The Colosseum was large enough for theatrical performances, festivals, circuses, or games, which the Imperial Court and high officials watched from the lowest level, aristocratic Roman families on the second, the populace on the third and fourth.

Beside the Colosseum stands the Arch of Constantine, a triumphal arch erected by the Senate to honor the emperor as "liberator of the city and bringer of peace" after his victory in the battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>  Vatican City  </strong></p>


	<p >The Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world, with an area of less than half a square kilometer, most of it enclosed by the Vatican walls.

Inside are the Vatican palace and gardens, St. Peter's Basilica, and St. Peter's Square, an area ruled by the Pope, supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church. This compact space offers a lot of things to see, between its museums and the great basilica itself.

Inside St. Peter's Basilica is Michelangelo's masterpiece, Pieta, along with statuary and altars by Bernini and others.

The unquestioned highlight of the Vatican museums is the Sistine Chapel, whose magnificent frescoed ceiling is Michelangelo's most famous work.

In the Vatican Palace are the Raphael Rooms; the Borgia Apartments; the Vatican Library, and a number of museums that include the Picture Gallery, Museum of Secular Art, Etruscan Museum, and others. The collections you can see in these cover everything from papal coaches to 20th-century art reflecting religious themes.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>  The Pantheon  </strong></p>


	<p >The Pantheon - the best-preserved monument of Roman antiquity - is remarkably intact for its 2000 years. This is despite the fact that Pope Gregory III removed the gilded bronze roof tiles, and Pope Urban VIII ordered its bronze roof stripped and melted down to cast the canopy over the altar in St. Peter's and cannons for Castel Sant'Angelo.

The Pantheon was rebuilt after damage by fire in AD 80, and the resulting brickwork shows the extraordinarily high technical mastery of Roman builders. Its 43-meter dome, the supreme achievement of Roman interior architecture, hangs suspended without visible supports – these are well hidden inside the walls – and its nine-meter central opening is the building's only light source.

The harmonious effect of the interior is a result of its proportions: the height is the same as the diameter.

Although the first Christian emperors forbade using this pagan temple for worship, in 609 Pope Boniface IV dedicated it to the Virgin and all the Christian martyrs, and since then, it has become the burial place of Italian kings (Victor Emmanuel II is in the second niche on the right) and other famous Italians, including the painter, Raphael.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong> Eiffel Tower   </strong></p>


	<p >The Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 330-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.

Upon the first glimpse, you'll be impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size. Next, the panoramas at each of the three levels will take your breath away.

You can dine with a view on the 1st floor or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne restaurant on the 2nd floor. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top floor offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>   Musée du Louvre  </strong></p><br>


	<p >The most prestigious museum in Paris, the Louvre ranks among the top European collections of fine arts. Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, the Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture.

The collection owes its wealth to the contributions of various kings who lived in the Louvre, in centuries past when it was a royal palace. Other pieces were added as a result of France's treaties with the Vatican and the Republic of Venice, and from the spoils of Napoléon I.

The Louvre displays around 35,000 artworks, including countless masterpieces. It's impossible to see it all in a day or even in a week. Take a private guided tour or focus on a shortlist of key artworks for the most rewarding experience.

	<strong>  Château de Versailles  </strong></p>


	<p >The UNESCO-listed Château de Versailles immerses you in France's glorious regal history. Step back in time to the era of the ancien régime, when Louis XIV (the "Sun King"), Louis XV, and Louis XVI ruled France. During that period, the Palace of Versailles set the standard for princely courts in Europe.

The most spectacular space in the palace is the Hall of Mirrors, where courtiers waited for an audience with His Majesty. This dazzling gallery sparkles with sunlight that enters through the windows and is reflected off hundreds of ornamental mirrors, while dozens of glittering chandeliers and gilded details make the overall impression even more marvelous.

Versailles is equally renowned for Les Jardins, formal French gardens featuring decorative pools, perfectly trimmed shrubbery, numerous statues, and magnificent fountains. The gardens were created in the 17th century by renowned landscape designer André Le Nôtre and are surrounded by 800 hectares of lush parkland.
