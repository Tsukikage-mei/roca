	<strong>  Whistler Mountain  </strong></p>


	<p >Just a two-hour drive from Vancouver is the famous ski resort of Whistler Blackcomb and the year-round resort destination of Whistler. While Whistler has always been an important winter sports area, it has also developed into a popular summer destination, with golf, mountain biking, and a lively town atmosphere no matter when you visit.

The village gained international attention in 2010 when it became one of the locations for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The area offers world class skiing, hotels, and dining, as well as a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and beautiful mountain scenery.

	<strong>   Polar Bears of Churchill  </strong></p>


	<p >One of Canada's most unique attractions is the polar bear migration that sees these beautiful creatures make their way from land out onto the ice in Hudson Bay, near the town of Churchill in Northern Manitoba.

This small community opens itself up to tourists each fall. Tours take visitors out in tundra buggies with caged windows for close encounters with the polar bears. The prime viewing time occurs in October or November while the bears are waiting for the water to freeze before heading out onto the ice.

	<strong>  Niagara Falls  </strong></p>

<p> Situated on the border of New York and Canada, the three waterfalls (Horseshoe Falls, American Falls and Bridalveil Falls) have the combined highest flow rate of any waterfall worldwide. Their impressive force is nothing short of awe-worthy. A top tourist destination since the 19th century, the unstoppable beauty and charm of Niagara Falls make it a memorable and unique landmark.

	<strong> NEW YORK  </strong></p><br><br>

	<a href="E:\Roca, Fiona\websystemfinal\america\new-york-city-statue-of-liberty.jpg"  target"_blank"><img src="E:\Roca, Fiona\websystemfinal\america\new-york-city-statue-of-liberty.jpg"   height"350" width="350" border="1" ></a>


	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>   Statue of Liberty  </strong></p>


	<p >America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty is at the top of every first-time visitor's list of things to do in New York. It was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of freedom and is one of the top attractions in America.

It is one of the world's largest statues, standing just under 152 feet tall from the base to the torch, and weighing approximately 450,000 pounds. You can see the statue from land, with particularly good views from Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan.

To truly appreciate the Statue of Liberty, the best thing to do is to take a short boat trip to Liberty Island and see it up close. Take a pleasant stroll around the base, and if you have reservations, enter the pedestal or the crown. The crown is open for tours, but book well in advance if you want to enjoy this special experience.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>  Central Park  </strong></p>


	<p >An oasis of green amongst New York's concrete canyons, Central Park is a sanctuary of peace and quiet for visitors and locals alike.

A walk, pedal, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on anyone's New York City itinerary. In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.

Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its borders, and most of them are free, making it one of the few cheap things to do in NYC. Some of the most popular places to visit include the Belvedere Castle, Strawberry Fields, the Central Park Zoo, and the Lake. If you are exploring the park on your own, start by picking up a map at one of the visitor centers and plot your route.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>  Metropolitan Museum of Art  </strong></p>


	<p >The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Met, as it is commonly known, was founded in 1870, and is one of the most famous museums in the United States. The permanent collection of The Met contains more than two million works of art, spanning a period of 5,000 years.

Although the museum has three sites, the centerpiece is The Met Fifth Avenue. Highlights of this collection include American decorative arts, arms and armor, costumes, Egyptian art, musical instruments, photographs, and much more.

Always-changing exhibitions bring some of the world's most famous works to the public.

The Met Cloisters, located in Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan, is another extremely popular New York museum. This branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, housed in an outstanding structure, built around medieval cloisters, chapels, and halls, focuses on the medieval art and architecture of Europe.

	<strong> ECUADOR  </strong></p><br><br>

<a href="E:\Roca, Fiona\websystemfinal\america\ecuador-galapagos-islands.jpg"  target"_blank"><img src="E:\Roca, Fiona\websystemfinal\america\ecuador-galapagos-islands.jpg"   height"350" width="350" border="1" ></a>


	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>  The Galápagos Islands  </strong></p>


	<p >Since their "discovery" in the 16th century, the Galápagos Islands have intrigued and inspired visitors from around the globe. Named for the giant tortoises on the islands, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to a unique ecosystem that largely evolved without outside influences (mainland Ecuador lies some 1,000 kilometers to the east). Consequently, a visit to this unspoiled region offers an exceptional opportunity for wildlife viewing. Here, you can see a variety of rare creatures both on land and in the surrounding seas.

The Galápagos Islands remain one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, and the formation of the islands is still in progress. Most of the 13 large islands, six smaller islands, and 42 islets that make up the Galápagos were declared part of the Galápagos National Park in the 1950s.

Not surprisingly, visiting this fragile ecosystem can only be undertaken as part of a guided tour to designated visitor sites. There are, however, one or two areas visitors can go without a guide, including some areas popular with scuba divers.

The main attraction here are the region's many rare bird species, of which 28 are unique to the islands. These include the Galápagos penguin, flightless cormorant, and waved albatross, along with the 13 species of Darwin's famous finches.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong> Cotopaxi and Cajas National Parks   </strong></p>


	<p >Two of Ecuador's most popular national parks, Cotopaxi (and Cajas, are within easy driving distances from the cities of Cuenca and Quito and make wonderful day trips. Of the two, Cotopaxi National Park (Parque Nacional Cotopaxi), just 50 kilometers south of Quito, is perhaps the best known.

Highlights of a visit include the opportunity to see its many volcanoes up close. The most remarkable of these is the massive (and still active), Cotopaxi volcano. With its last eruption as recent as 2015, this massive volcano, along with the smaller Rumiñawi and Sincholagua volcanoes, dominates the area's stunning scenery.

About 30 kilometers from Cuenca in Ecuador's stunning highlands, Cajas National Park (Parque Nacional Cajas) offers a very different experience due to its numerous hills and valleys, making it a perfect place to hike and bike. It's also a delight for water sports enthusiasts, particularly kayakers and canoeists, thanks to its more than 270 lagoons and glacier-fed lakes.

	<p  style="font-size:20px;">
	<strong>   The Hot Springs of Baños </strong></p>


	<p >Thanks to its lovely surroundings and numerous hot springs, the small town of Baños de Agua Santa is a popular tourist destination within central Ecuador. Located at the western edge of the Amazon basin, Baños is nestled among dense jungle-like forests and offers numerous recreational opportunities including hiking and mountain biking.

But the big draw are its mineral-rich hot springs and many waterfalls. Some of the best of these beautiful waterfalls are easily accessible from the town via a series of trails incorporating rope bridges with incredible views over the falls and their deep pools.

Adventure sports such as whitewater rafting and kayaking are also popular here. More sedate things to do include visiting landmarks such as the Virgen de Agua Santa church with its famous statue of Mary (it's claimed she appeared at one of the town's waterfalls).

Other things to do in Baños de Agua Santa include shopping for local goods. Some of the most popular Ecuador souvenirs found here include the colorful carved balsa parrots. Be sure to also sample the town's famous "melcocha," a type of candy made from cane sugar.
